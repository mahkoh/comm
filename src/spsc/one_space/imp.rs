            //    might call `unwrap` on an empty `receiver_thread`.
            //
            // 2) There is a short moment here between us setting `RECEIVER_SLEEPING` and

            //    sender thread calls `Thread::unpark` before we've actually gone to
            //    sleep. This works because `Thread::park` is backed by a semaphore.
